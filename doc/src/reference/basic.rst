Basic Math Functions
====================

General
-------

.. function:: abs(x)

    Return the absolute value of ``x``, commonly written as \|x\|. In real mode, it flips the sign of a negative number, thus forcing it to be positive. When given a complex number as argument, it returns the modulus of the number.

    The argument can have a dimension.

    Example::

        abs(-3 meter)
        = 3 meter

        abs(4 + 3j)
        = 5

.. function:: sqrt(x)

    Return the square root of ``x``. If complex numbers are disabled, this function is only defined for *x > 0*. In *complex mode*, any complex number may be specified, yielding the complex root in the upper half plane.

    The argument may have a dimension.

.. function:: cbrt(x)

    Compute the third (cubic) root of ``x``. In *real mode*, it accepts any real number. Negative numbers will yield a negative cubic root::

        cbrt(-27)
        = -3

    In *complex mode*, this function accepts any complex input. The result will generally be the first complex root, i.e. the one with a phase between 0 and π/3. Real negative arguments however will still yield a real (negative) result, matching the function's behavior in *real mode*. Use ``x^(1/3)`` to get the first complex root.

.. function:: exp(x)

    Compute the natural exponential function.

    The argument must be dimensionless.

    .. seealso::
       | :func:`ln` (natural logarithm)
       | :func:`lg` (binary logarithm)
       | :func:`log` (arbitrary base logarithm)

.. function:: ln(x)

    Compute the natural logarithm. In *real mode*, the argument must be real, with *x > 0*.

    In *complex mode*, any non-zero number may be given. The result will be the principal value. The branch cut runs across the negative real axis. Nevertheless, in SpeedCrunch :func:`ln` is defined for negative real numbers as *ln(-x) = ln(\|x\|)) + πj*, extending the branch from the *upper* half-plane.

.. function:: lb(x)

    Compute the binary logarithm. In *complex mode* the same rules apply as for :func:`ln`.

.. function:: lg(x)

    Compute the decimal logarithm. In *complex mode* the same rules apply as for :func:`ln`.

.. function:: log(n; x)

    Compute the logarithm of base ``n`` . In *complex mode* the same rules apply as for :func:`ln`.
