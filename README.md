# SpeedCrunch
SpeedCrunch is a high-precision scientific calculator. It features a syntax-highlighted
scrollable display and is designed to be fully used via keyboard. Some distinctive
features are auto-completion of functions and variables, a formula book, and quick
insertion of constants from various fields of knowledge. It is available for Windows, OS X,
and Linux in a number of languages.

## Building
To build SpeedCrunch, you need:

- A C++11-capable compiler (e.g. Microsoft Visual C++ 2013 or later, GCC 4.8 or later)
- [Qt](http://qt.io) 5.2 or later
- [CMake](http://cmake.org) 3.0 or later

To build SpeedCrunch in a dedicated build directory and install it, run the following
commands from the root of the source directory:

    mkdir build
    cd build
    cmake ../src
    make install

When building against a Qt version that is not the system default Qt installation,
point CMake towards the Qt installation to use by setting the `CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH`
environment variable to the prefix directory of the Qt installation when running CMake.

You can customize the build using the following variables. These are specified when
running CMake, in the form `cmake ../src -Dvariable=value`.

- **PORTABLE_SPEEDCRUNCH**: Set this to `on` to have the application settings stored
  in the same location as the executable, e.g. for running from a USB drive without
  requiring installation.
- **CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX**: Change the installation prefix for SpeedCrunch.
- **HTML_DOCS_DIR**: Change the path to the HTML manual that's embedded in the binary
  by the build. By default, a bundled prebuilt copy is used to minimize dependencies.

## Building the HTML manual
Building the HTML manual is normally not necessary because a prebuilt copy is included
with the SpeedCrunch source. Rebuilding the manual requires the following additional
software:

  - [Python](http://python.org) 3.4 or later
  - [Sphinx](http://sphinx-doc.org) 1.3 or later
  - [the Quark theme](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/quark-sphinx-theme) 0.2 or later

To build the manual in a dedicated build directory, run the following commands from
the root of the source directory:

    mkdir docs-build
    cd docs-build
    cmake ../doc/src
    make

Then, when building SpeedCrunch itself, point the `HTML_DOCS_DIR` to your manual build
directory:

    cmake <SpeedCrunch source>/src -DHTML_DOCS_DIR=<manual build dir>
